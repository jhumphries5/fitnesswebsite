    Hello!

I am Janelle Humphries and I have had a passion for fitness for over a decade. Throughout my childhood I played various sports including volleyball, softball, and track & field. Once I went to college, my focus shifted to weight lifting since I was no longer playing any organized sports but wanted to make fitness a priority.<br>
<br>
I am 21 years old and work a full-time job in Tech. I grew up in Dutchess County, New York but moved to the Albany area for work. I studied at Syracuse University where I studied Information Management and Technology. <br>
<br>
My focus is trying to show people how you can work a full-time job and still make fitness a priority in your life. All it takes is a little dedication and discipline to get any results you want in the gym! <br>
<br>
Come with me on my fitness journey so we can grow together! <br>
<br>
 
  <!-- This about page is important because it gives some background on myself. In the fitness industry, credibilites is essential. I wanted to give a little bit about myself because people cannot trust your workout plan unless they trust you! -->
