    1. Eating healthy is only sustainable if you balance it out. Eat WHAT YOU WANT! If you are craving something that is considered “unhealthy”, it is still okay to eat it and see results. Having a little bit of anything in moderation will not ruin your results or make you unhealthy. <br>
    <br>
2. If you want to maintain a healthy diet, having your cravings here and there will ensure you are not limiting yourself. <br>
<br>
3. Having the mindset of “I cannot eat this piece of chocolate” will only make you want it more. Then, people tend to over eat when they do eat their cravings. Instead of saying “I can never have chocolate”, try “I will only have half of this piece of chocolate today, and I’ll save the rest for tomorrow!” <br>
<br>
4. Eat what you want so you are living a balanced, healthy and HAPPY life! <br>
